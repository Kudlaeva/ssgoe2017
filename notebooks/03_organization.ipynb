As the starting point for a project the README file is formatted as plain text (or [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)) to make it easily readable. A README file should include the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The project name\n",
    "- The date the README was created\n",
    "- Contact information for the person(s) who maintains the project\n",

    "Think about the beginning of this lesson, when we had nothing but a file with a name. These are the things that would have made it easy to make sense of that data.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Adding a Top Level README -- Exercise (5 min)\n",
    "\n",
    "To add a README to our project, open a text editor. For Mac users this can be [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html), [NotePad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) for Windows users.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Adding a README in a Subdirectory\n",
    "\n",
    "README files in subdirectories are a good idea too. Often there are many files, and it's distracting to fill the top-level README with details about smaller pieces of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For raw data directories, you should include the location (e.g URL) where the file was retrieved or generated.\n",
    "- For modified data directories, you should include the exact tools and steps used to modify the data, along with dates\n",
    "- For other directories like code or documentation, the README should communicate what the directories contain.\n",

    "### Cleaning data by hand\n",
    "Now that we've created a README for our data, it's time to begin the cleaning process. Open the data file in `01_cleaning` using Excel (Or if you prefer a text editor, [here is the tab-delimited version](../data/gapminderDataFiveYear_superDirty.txt)). Let's take a look at the current state of our data, and find some parts of it worth cleaning.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Recording our actions\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we've use a GUI editor in order to make these modifications manually, we must also record our actions manually with a README file. READMEs are useful for giving a person context about the data contained within a folder. In this case, the context we wish to give are the steps that have been taken in order to create this cleaned dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pitfalls of manually cleaning data\n",
    "\n",
    "You might think that this is a pretty labor-intensive process. Maybe you're even questioning the value of writing each of these steps down manually. It's true - recording each modification by hand is time-consuming. It's also easy to forget steps, mis-represent what you've done, and generally poorly convey the true state of the data. For this reason, it's much preferred to use a *script* to automate the cleaning of your data. We'll cover this in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another challenge with using GUIs is that they tend to have different ways of doing the same thing. For example, bring up the `Save As` menu in the editor that you're using. You might notice that there are many options for saving this data on top of simply specifying a file name and location. In addition, some GUIs have different labels for each row / column. Excel begins its rows at `1`, while python begins its rows with `0`. It is important to record all information about the program used to modify the data, as well as any considerations that should be taken when interpreting the cleaned data.\n",
