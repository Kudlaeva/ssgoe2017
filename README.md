# This is just a testing page

The main part of this attempt, is to see if I can link the _reveal.js_ presentation,
the _html-report_ and the _pdf_ file that I've created from jupyter, from here. 

So let's see

- [Workshop Preperation](notebooks/00_preperation.html)

- [the presentation](Presentation.slides.html)
- [the static html](Presentation.html)
- [the pdf](Presentation.pdf)

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/gekaklam/presentation-testing/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/gekaklam/presentation-testing/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
